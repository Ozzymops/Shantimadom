Shanti Madom Foundations
On 9 October 2008, a non-profit organization, named Stichting Shanti Madom, or the Shanti Madom Foundation, was founded in The Netherlands & Belgium to support Swami Atmachaithanya’s good work. It is totally run by volunteer work.

Other goals are to help to coordinate Swami’s tour in Europe, especially in Belgium and The Netherlands, and to raise funds for Swamiji’s Humanitarian Work

A web shop has been set up, so the lovely organic herbal soaps, beautiful mala’s etc can be bought all year round. The profits of these sales go directly to Swamiji’s Humanitarian Work.

Donations for Swami Atmachaithanya go to His Humanitarian work and are given personally to Him.

Separate donations are welcome to cover for His travel-expenses

If you want to want to volunteer in this foundation or at Swami’s tour, please contact us via email
